Retrospective
what went well:
- weekly meetings (in tutorial, outside of tutorial)
- our teammates allocate tasks evenly
- communication was respectful and collaborative
- everyone was open to feedback and wiling to adjust their work
- good use of shared tools (Github, Jira) to keep track of tasks
- each teammate contributed consistently and met agreed deadlines (most of us finished our tasks way before deadlines)
- everyone was proactive in taking ownership to their assigned tasks
- the group maintained a positive and supportive atmosphere

challenges:
- as we only got to know each other, each of us have different levels of technical knowledge, so allocating tasks in the beginning required more times as we had to make sure everyone was working on parts they were most confident at.
- occasional misunderstandings during discussion and brainstorming activities
- meeting attendance was not always 100% due to schedule conflicts
- limited experience with certain tools/technologies meant extra learning time was required

improvement actions:
- improve communication by documenting decisions from each meeting in a shared log after every meeting in the shared platform so everyone stays aligned
- encourage all members to ask questions early if requirements are unclear
- schedule short midweek online checkins to keep progress aligned
